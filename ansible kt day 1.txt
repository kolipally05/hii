    ANSIBLE:

* Ansible is an open source tool

* Ansible is used to create Infrastructures(small and medium)

* Ansible is an configuration management tool

* configuration management means maintains the number of machines with automation (100's and 1000's)

maintains?

It maintains the system resources such as 

-> Install a application

-> configuration

-> updates

-> maintain and soon

 why configuration management tool?

 -> Reduce management complexity
 -> save time


----------------------------------------------
Infrastructure as a code:

with the code csn manage thr Infrastructure

----------------------------------

-> Ansible is great at provisioning Infrastructures

-----------------------------

configuration management tools:

  puppet-> 2005  (pull based mechanism)
  
  chef-> 2004 (pull based mechanim)

  ansible -> 2011 (push based mechanism)

------------------------------------------------------

Advantages:

-> Free: It is open source tool

-> very simple to setup and use: No special coding skills are mecessary 
iou
-> Agentless:
dont need to install any other extra softwares
No agent to install or update
Industry standard SSH or WinRM
No additional firewall rules

-> powerful : Ansible lets you model even highly complex IT workflows

Configuration Management-> consistency of all systems in the infrastructure is maintained
Application deployment-> Applications are deployed automatically on variety of environents
Cloud provisioning
Workflow orchestration



-> efficient:  dont need to install any other extra softwares


why Ansible?

-> This is mohan, a system administrator. I am responsible for all the servers for  my companys infrastructure
 for example there are 3 web servers and  2 database servers
 i want to install apache on 3 web servers and sql on 2 database servers
what if number of servers increases?
the same task must be repeated multiple times.moreever humans are prone to make errors...This is where ansible comes into rescue

with ansible a code is written once and deployed multiple times



----------------
The difference between automation and orchestration

So, while automation refers to a single task, orchestration arranges tasks to optimize
a workflow. For example, orchestrating an app means not only deploying an
application, but also connecting it to the network so it can communicate with users and other apps.

--------------------------------------------
Disadvantages of Ansible

Insufficient User Interface:

Ansible was initially a command-line only tool. 
The first effort of Ansible at making a user interface was with AWX graphical user interface.
Subsequently, the AWX turned into the Ansible Tower, which is a web management UI.
Ansible Tower offers visual management features and a team-based workflow instrument.
However, the Ansible Tower requires considerable improvements. 
For example, almost 85% of tasks that could be completed through the command line can be achieved through the UI. 

----------------------------
module?
 module is a collection of configuration code files
 Thsese configuration code files are called playbooks
 Inventory is a document that groups the nodes under specific lables
